Dataset IRM
###########

This data set is used in the project "Nulalternatief IRM" (Asselman et al., 2022). By performing simulation in D-HYDRO new discharge-depth relations are developed for multiple bedlevel scenario's. The built of consists of new and old data and is well descriped in the report.

In this project a correction has been done for the difference in underkeel clearance (UKC) for different channels. The data 'Q_VD' contains the original data (similar to KBN_v0.6), but the data Q_Diepgang has been corrected by subtracting the UKC. For alluvial parts, canals and fixed layers, different UKC are assumed.
